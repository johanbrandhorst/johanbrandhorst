### Hello :wave:

I'm Johan, I've been doing open source since 2016, mostly in the Go ecosystem 🐻. I'm currently a maintainer 👨‍🔧 of:

- [**The Go WebAssembly Port**](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly) 🌐, allowing the use of Go in the browser and the backend.
- [**The gRPC-Gateway**](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) 🌉, a HTTP/JSON <-> gRPC translation layer which is serving companies and open source projects such as [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway.md), [Core OS](https://coreos.com/blog/grpc-protobufs-swagger.html), [Cockroach DB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) and others.
- [**Certify**](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/certify) 👨‍⚖️, a Go in-process certificate manager that automatically issues and renews certificates for your application.

I'm also a contributor 👨‍💻 to:

- [**The Go standard library**](https://github.com/golang/go), especially the WebAssembly port, where I ported the GopherJS `net/http` implementation to the standard library, allowing the use of `net/http` HTTP requests from inside WebAssembly applications. I also wrote many of the proposals for greater WASI support, including the [wasip1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58141), [go:wasmimport](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/59149), [go:wasmexport](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65199) and [function ABI type restriction relaxation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/66984) proposals, all of which are now part of the Go compiler.
- [**The encoding/json/v2 experiment**](https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json), in which I've primarily contributed with code review and design suggestions.
- [**gRPC-Go**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go), the official gRPC library for Go.

I author blog posts 📰 on varying topics, mostly relating to Go and gRPC on [my personal website](https://jbrandhorst.com).

I also frequently deliver technical talks 🗨️ at conferences, including [**GopherCon San Diego** 🇺🇸](https://www.gophercon.com), [**GopherCon UK** 🇬🇧](https://www.gophercon.co.uk), [**dotGo** 🇫🇷](https://www.dotgo.eu), [**GopherCon EU** 🇪🇺](https://gophercon.berlin/), [**FOSDEM** 🇧🇪](https://fosdem.org) and more. I've also featured on [**Go Time** 🎙️](https://changelog.com/gotime) on topics ranging from security 🛡️ to PostgreSQL 🐘. [My personal website](https://jbrandhorst.com/page/presentations) contains all the recordings and slides of my presentations.

Lastly, I'm frequently helping 👨‍🏫 beginners and experienced users alike to solve problems with their code and setup on Gophers slack, in particular on the topics that I have specific expertise, such as gRPC, protobuf and security. I can be found in the Gophers Slack under the username `jbrandhorst`. Come say hi!
